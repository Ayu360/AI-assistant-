# Virtual AI Assistant

This Virtual AI Assistant is a Python-based project aimed at providing various functionalities 
to assist users with tasks like taking screenshots, browsing the web, setting alarms, playing 
songs from YouTube, and more. Below is a breakdown of the code and its functionalities.


## How to Install Required Libraries

Before running the code, make sure you have Python installed on your system. 
You can install the required libraries using pip, Python's package installer,
by running the following command:

```pip install pyttsx3 pyautogui keyboard webbrowser pywhatkit SpeechRecognition PyDictionary playsound```


## Libraries Used and Their Roles:

*pyttsx3:* This library is used for text-to-speech conversion, allowing the assistant to communicate audibly with the user.

*os:* The os module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.

*datetime:* This module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

*pyautogui:* It is used for taking screenshots of the screen.

*keyboard:* This library enables the assistant to control keyboard input.

*webbrowser:* Used to launch a browser and display web-based documents.

*pywhatkit:* Enables the assistant to perform various actions related to YouTube, such as playing songs.

*SpeechRecognition:* Allows the assistant to recognize speech input from the user.

*PyDictionary:* Used for retrieving word meanings from an online dictionary.

*playsound:* This library is used to play audio files.


## Explanation of Methods:

*speak(audio):* This method utilizes pyttsx3 to convert text to speech and audibly communicate with the user. It also prints the given audio message to the console.

*takecommand():* This function listens to the user's voice input using the microphone and converts it into text using the SpeechRecognition module.

*greeting():* It greets the user when the program starts.

*Dict(query):* This function activates the dictionary feature and retrieves the meaning of a word provided by the user.

*screenshot():* Allows the user to take a screenshot of the screen.

*ChromeAuto():* Automates various tasks in the Google Chrome browser based on user commands.

*setAlarm():* Sets an alarm based on user input.

*takeNote():* Allows the user to dictate something for the assistant to remember.

*readNote():* Reads back what the user asked the assistant to remember.

*playSong():* Searches and plays a song from YouTube.

*taskExe():* Main function that executes the assistant functionalities based on user commands.

## In-built Methods:

open(): Opens a file for reading, writing, or appending.

write(): Writes data to the file.

read(): Reads the contents of the file.

init(): Initializes the text-to-speech engine.

getProperty(): Retrieves properties of the text-to-speech engine.

setProperty(): Sets properties for the text-to-speech engine.

listen(): Listens to the audio input from the microphone.

recognize_google(): Recognizes speech input using Google Speech Recognition API.
